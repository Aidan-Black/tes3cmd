[This is stuff JMS writes to himself.]

- implement script compiler
- make tes3cmd work with wrye mash
- GUI
- support LAND/LTEX records
- better documentation
- merge dialog
- Landscape height conflict detection
- OpenMW support

change default backup strategy to stash in tes3cmd/Backups
field name inputs should be automatically lowercased so they match correctly.
delete should support subrecord groups. (what do with MVRF ???)
delete should have --subrec-from & --subrec-to
#
#add: convertdeletedtodisabled command
- check that re-dating of cleaned (synced?) plugins works correctly on XP.
"recover" needs to detect overwritten length fields, perhaps by backing up 1 record to previous good record start, and scan from there
savegame cleaner: reset NPC heads/hair (recapitate)
improve corrupted INFO (mwedit) detection, and possibly clean them
implement a "repack" command: bsaunpack + tesfiles/resourcecheck + clean
TES3::File (open_for_input, backup, etc)?
implement proper verbosity
check if unnecessary backups are made during fixit
cleanup .tmp if die
clean would be sped up if command added a "clean <size>" mark to plugin (use unused space in header?)
   but it would probably not be good to change size of masters, at least.
   instead cache in cachedir filesize + tes3cmd version and reclean if changed.
GUI?
add tes3spell after GUI
reformat overdial output? just list each topic once, with list of plugins that have it

to "header" command: add abitlity to add/remove masters
# # # # # # # # # # # # # #
add new commands:
* conflict report (like TESPCD)
* stats: dump a bunch of record counts/etc.
* install/remove: install and remove mods
* quest - dump INFO/SCPT records relevent to a quest, in quest order, pretty-printed
* extract - dump subset of records by following dependencies
* "gen-res" (generate resources catalog cells) poop out an esp that displays matching objects in various cells:
     # put all mold cave static pieces in a test cell named "Mold Cave" and all guard NPCs in a cell named "Guards"
     # maybe also specify distance between objects in generated cell
     tes3cmd genres --resource "/Guards/npc_/class:guard/" --resource "/Mold Cave/stat/^in_mold/" --plugin my_resources.esp *.esm
* bsa: --add/--remove/--list
* "sos" (save our save) or "bisect" for doing a binary search for bad records/subrecords in a savegame
* "buildcache" (build up all the cache files for cleaning, lookups, etc)
* "codec" (print text description of TES3 codec)
* "undo" (revert to last backups for modifying commands)
* "tidy" (remove cache and undo stuff)
* "undump" (canonical text to record, can't undump from wrong version)
* "combine" (merge listed plugins into one plugin)
* "conflict" (detailed report, toggle mergeable records from report)
# # # # # # # # # # # # # #
* "multipatch", to include:
** automatically patch overdial problems?
** gmst/global tweaks: (timescale, fCombatAngleXY)
** import faces/hairs (avoid conflicts by dropping rest of object definition)
** merge objects
*** Notes: pre-scan for mergeable objects, save to cache file (foreach plugin save ID,record_offset)
           only read mergeable objects into memory (in load order) if defined in more than 2 plugins
*** Object Merge Gotchas
**** autocalced vs. non-autocalced NPCs NPDT
**** deleted body parts from clothes (redefining the set of body parts for a CLOT) (grouped subrecs)
**** handle patch plugins that are *supposed* to only override the patchee (auto-detect?)
# # # # # # # # # # # # # #
lint:
* check for possible doubling: objects with nearly the same coordinates/angles
* check references with extremely high coordinates
* pathgrid points at x=0,y=0,z=0 (nconn==0 is better)
* MVRFs in .esm files
* check for dialog edits that lose part of the filter.
* add note about creating a shortcut on Windows
* check for addtopic of non-existant dialog topics?
* add a check for missing icons, etc.?
* add a check for signrotate contamination (difficult to impossible)
* OVR-REC specials: PGRD.?
* check for use of == on floats in scripts! (gamehour)
* Check for accidental conversion of float to short (putting getsecondspassed into short truncates)
* duplicate records should also check for change in flags!
* Check for scripts that are saved but not compiled.
