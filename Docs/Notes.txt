[This is stuff JMS writes to himself.]

=== v0.40 ===
- finish object merging
- double check use of case folding filenames, let's only do it for plugins
from non-command line inputs, as from Morrowind.ini or MAST header records
- Finish --output implementation: $DUMP_RAWOUT --> $OUTFH (set binmode accordingly)
  doublecheck setting output to STDOUT
- Finish renaming of fields for use with --format dump option
- better documentation (builtin and wiki)

=== POST v0.40 ===
- refactor helps to reduce duplication
- move some globals into packages or closures
- make new_from_input more robust in the face of file corruption.
- implement script compiler
- make tes3cmd work with wrye mash
- OpenMW support
- Landscape height conflict detection(fixing?)
- delete should support subrecord groups. (what do with MVRF ???)
- delete should have --subrec-from & --subrec-to
- add: convertdeletedtodisabled command???
- check that re-dating of cleaned (synced?) plugins works correctly on Windows.
- make "recover" more robust: "recover" needs to detect overwritten length fields, perhaps by backing up 1 record to previous good record start, and scan from there
- savegame cleaner: reset NPC heads/hair (recapitate)
- improve corrupted INFO (mwedit) detection, and possibly clean them
- bsa support: implement a "repack" command: bsaunpack + tesfiles/resourcecheck + clean
- redo object model? TES3::File (open_for_input, backup, etc)?
- implement proper verbosity
- check if unnecessary backups are made during fixit
- cleanup .tmp if die
- clean would be sped up if command added a "clean <size>" mark to plugin (use unused space in header?)
   but it would probably not be good to change size of masters, at least.
   instead cache in cachedir filesize + tes3cmd version and reclean if changed.
- spellchecker?
- reformat overdial output? just list each topic once, with list of plugins that have it
- "header" command: add abitlity to add/remove masters
- GUI?
- merge dialog

add new commands:
- conflict report (like TESPCD)(detailed report, toggle mergeable records from report)
- install/remove: install and remove mods
- quest - dump INFO/SCPT records relevent to a quest, in quest order, pretty-printed
- extract - dump subset of records by following dependencies
- "gen-res" (generate resources catalog cells) poop out an esp that displays matching objects in various cells:
     # put all mold cave static pieces in a test cell named "Mold Cave" and all guard NPCs in a cell named "Guards"
     # maybe also specify distance between objects in generated cell
     tes3cmd genres --resource "/Guards/npc_/class:guard/" --resource "/Mold Cave/stat/^in_mold/" --plugin my_resources.esp *.esm
- "sos" (save our save) or "bisect" for doing a binary search for bad records/subrecords in a savegame
- "buildcache" (build up all the cache files for cleaning, lookups, etc)
- "codec" (print text description of TES3 codec)
- "undo" (revert to last backups for modifying commands)
- "tidy" (remove cache and undo stuff)
- "undump" (canonical text to record, can't undump from wrong version)
- "combine" (merge listed plugins into one plugin)

- automatically patch overdial problems?
- gmst/global tweaks: (timescale, fCombatAngleXY)
- import faces/hairs (avoid conflicts by dropping rest of object definition)

lint:
- check for possible doubling: objects with nearly the same coordinates/angles
- check references with extremely high coordinates
- pathgrid points at x=0,y=0,z=0 (nconn==0 is better)
- MVRFs in .esm files
- check for dialog edits that lose part of the filter.
- add note about creating a shortcut on Windows
- check for addtopic of non-existant dialog topics?
- add a check for signrotate contamination (difficult to impossible)
- OVR-REC specials: PGRD.?
- check for use of == on floats in scripts! (gamehour)
- Check for accidental conversion of float to short (putting getsecondspassed into short truncates)
- duplicate records should also check for change in flags!
- Check for scripts that are saved but not compiled.
