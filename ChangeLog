	SUMMARY OF CHANGES SINCE 0.37v:

	* Fixed faction (FACT) record stringification that caused a
	bug in the diff command.

	* New global option --output <filename>. Helps avoid shell
	processing necessary for redirecting output.

	* New dump options: --binary --header that can be used with
	--output intead of --raw and --raw-with-header.

	* Added --active command switch to limit processing to active plugins

	* Added Initial support for LAND records.

	* Removed Config::IniFiles it choked on some malformed
	Morrowind.ini entries that Morrowind sometimes created. Now we use
	my own sloppy read_gamefiles()/write_gamefiles() which are more
	tolerant of Morrowind's idiosynchracies.

	* tes3cmd now expects to live in Morrowind/tes3cmd/, and it will put
	things like backups and cache files and other stuff there. This is
	to avoid polluting the users "Data Files".

	* The options --match and --nomatch can now be specified multiple
	times which makes it a lot easier to specify complicated matches.

	* There is a new rudimentary dump option (--format) that allows
	the user to select specfic fields for display. This feature may
	change completely by release. To help make this feature user
	friendly, some field name changes have been made, such as the
	"flags" field in "NPC_::AIDT" is now "services" as it is more
	specific and better describes what those flags are for.

	* The diff command can now sort subrecords before comparing
	records. diff comparisons are strictly based on textual
	represenation of records of same rectype/id. This solves the
	problem that in some cases, ordering of subrecords differs between
	the two plugins being compared, but they are functionally
	equivalent. The diff feature may be completely reworked in the
	future.

	* The modify command now supports --replacefirst, in case user
	doesn't want to replace all matching occurrences.

	* The leveled lists merging has been fixed to preserve deletions
	from leveled lists as defined by plugins that come later in the
	load order. This should now work better than Wrye Mash's leveled
	list merger.

	* You can now specify creatures/items to be deleted from leveled
	lists when the multipatch is created with --delete-creature and
	--delete-item.

	* Help has been slightly reorganized, when tes3cmd is invoked with
	no arguments, you get only a short "minihelp". To get a list of
	supported commands, you now type "tes3cmd help".

	* The INFO::INTV field "compare_value" has been corrected to
	signed long from unsigned.

	* The compiled bytecode of SCPT::SCDT has more correctly elided.

	* There is a new convenience method for record objects: getfield().

	* The dump option --raw <file> now *appends* to the specified file
	if it already exists. This just handles the common case that the
	user wishes to collect raw data in a new plugin, now they don't
	have to manually append stuff.

	* There is some rudimentary code to support command extensions.
	For example: tes3cmd mycommand(.pl) --myoption1 ....
	This would run a custom tes3cmd extension called "mycommand.pl"
	that defines a new command. This feature could be used to write
	and share Morrowind mods that are generated dynamically instead of
	as plugins.
	This feature may or may not be completely reworked in the future
	as the API for writing extensions doesn't even really exist yet
	unless you read the tes3cmd code and understand it (heh heh).

	* When plugins are listed on the command line, tes3cmd now sorts
	them in order by modification date, just as they would be ordered
	in your load order.
